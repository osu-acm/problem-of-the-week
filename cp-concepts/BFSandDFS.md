BFS and DFS
===

Breadth-first search and depth-first search are two algorithms used in graphs extensively. They both traverse potentially all nodes in the graph. The only difference between the two is the order in which they traverse the nodes. BFS goes to all nodes `n` units away from the starting node before going `n + 1` units away. DFS goes through an entire path deeply before backtracking out to find the next path.

Try to do the below problems both iteratively (with stack/queue) and recursively if possible.
