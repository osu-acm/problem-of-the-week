# Binary search

Binary search is a class of algorithms used for searching a data structure. The classic example is given a sorted array, find if an element exists in O(logn) time. There are tons of trivial ways to do things in O(n) time, but you should always think about using binary search to speed things up. Binary search is also applied in many data structures such as heaps, priority queues, and binary search trees, and segment trees.
