Dynamic programming
===

Dynamic programming (DP) is the process of splitting a problem into smaller problems and remembering the answers to them. Most algorithms (specifically recursive algorithms) split big problems into smaller problems so DP is used extensively to reduce runtime complexity of those algorithms. The process of remembering the answers to sub-problems is called memoization. Normally you can tell that a problem can be solved by DP when as early as when you read the title of the problem.

This is a great tutorial to how DP can be used: [Hackerrank: Memoization and DP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Xa2BitN3I)
