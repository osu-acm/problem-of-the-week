# Problem of the week #10: Shortest path

This week's problem topic is finding the shortest path in a graph. There are many cool algorithms that do this, and finding the shortest path between two nodes is a classic graph theory problem. I won't go too much in detail about some of these algorithms and instead just give you the problem: [link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/20/C).

Hint: The algorithm you should use to solve the problem is in the title. Here's a cute video on it: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdmfOwyQlcI).
