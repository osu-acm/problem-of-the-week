# Problem of the week #11: Sliding window

Some of you may remember a short meeting we had last Spring that went over sliding window algorithms. These algorithms are generally pretty niche, but sometimes problems will combine their concept with other algorithm types such as DP. They are very useful to know for interviews as well.

Sliding window algorithms involve two pointers: One "fast" pointer, and one "end" pointer. The fast pointer can move until some criteria is met then the end pointer moves, or both can move at the same time (i.e. detect a cycle in a graph). 

Here's this week's tutorial that goes more in-depth: https://medium.com/leetcode-patterns/leetcode-pattern-2-sliding-windows-for-strings-e19af105316b. Please try to do at least one problem from it!
