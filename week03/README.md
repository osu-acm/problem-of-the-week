# Problem of the week #3 - Greedy algorithms

This week's problem topic is <b>greedy algorithms</b>. Greedy algorithms are another classic algorithm type that shows up in all sorts of programming competitions. It follows a simple formula: Iterate through a number of rounds and take the local optimal step each time. This is why they're called "greedy"; they take the best thing every round, not taking the future into account whatsoever.

And now for this week's problem: [545C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/545/C)

Also, check out #competitions on Slack for competition links! And check out #jobs for job ad sharing. I will be posting internship and new grad links. Please let me know if you have any questions about this week's problem or last week's problem!
