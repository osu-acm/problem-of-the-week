# Problem of the week #5: Union find

Union find is a really cool algorithm and data structure that keeps track of disjoint sets. It is used mostly in graph problems (classic example is if you want to figure out if a graph is connected or not). Here is a link to a cool tutorial on it: [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find/)

Please do this Leetcode problem (or at least look at the solution in Discuss and follow along with how union find works with it): [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/)

If you are feeling for a challenge, here is a really cool problem from the Benelux Programming Competition in 2018 that uses union find and BFS (but is tricky to figure out when to use union find!): [link](https://codeforces.com/gym/102007/attachments). Check out problem D: Driver Disagreement.

Hope everyone is having a rocking summer!
