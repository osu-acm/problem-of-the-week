# Problem of the week #9 - Sorting

This week's problem topic is sorting. Sorting algorithms are super useful in competitive programming problems, and one of the first questions you can ask yourself when solving a problem is "Will sorting the input array make this easier?". In some cases, it 100% will.

There are a lot of sorting algorithms out there. The fastest ones are merge sort and quick sort (both of which are O(nlogn)) and counting sort (O(n)). However, counting sort requires the range of values in the array, so most of the time, merge and quick sort are used. It is good to know the implementation of either merge or quick sort.

In competitive programming, sorting is largely taken care for you via the C++'s standard template library. Just use the sort function!

Here's this week's problem:

If you would like to practice counting sort, try this problem out:

Thanks everyone and have a good week!
