# Problem of the week #1 - Orientation

Welcome to the first problem of the summer! First off, I want to give some general information about programming competitions:

* About 80% of competitive programmers use C++. I would highly recommend using it.
* Most competitions use stdin and stdout (cin and cout) for input and output. I've attached a very helpful pdf that our faculty advisor, Prof. Mike Bailey, created that has general tips surrounding this topic.
* You can use my starter C++ template located here if you would like to use it. The  #include<bits/stdc++.h> includes the entirety of STL, and the first two lines of main() make input/output slightly faster.

Now, onto the problem! It is: [50A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/50/A). This is a very simple problem that will help you get familiar with the competitive programming format. Please make an account on Codeforces so you can submit your solution and check if it's right! If you would like to discuss solutions, join the `#problems` channel on Slack.
