# Problem of the week #2
Hope everyone is having an awesome week. This week, we'll be discussing an incredibly interesting and fun algorithm type: <b>Dynamic programming</b>. Dynamic programming, or DP, is a process that splits a problem into smaller sub-problems (and those into even smaller sub-problems, etc.) until they are do-able. It uses memoization (fancy word for storing results of problems in memory) to store the results of the sub-problems so that the algorithm doesn't need to re-calculate the sub-problem. It is a faster, easier, and better way to implement quite a few recursive functions. Normally it requires an array of varying dimensions (there are a few infamous interview problems that require 3D arrays, yikes) that store the results of each sub problem.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND watching this video on DP: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Xa2BitN3I)

The problem of the week requires knowledge of DP. It is a classic competitive programming re-skin of a problem seen in interviews/contests all the time (google "the coin problem" if you want to take a look). Here it is: [189A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/189/A)

Hope everyone enjoys this problem! If you are having trouble or are stuck for more than 30 minutes, please send a message in #problems on the Slack!
