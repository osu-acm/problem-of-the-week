# Problem of the week #7 - Prime numbers
Hope y'all are having an excellent week. This week's topic: Prime numbers! Competitive programming has a lot of math incorporated into it. Almost every year, there are 1-2 questions in ICPC centered around prime numbers. I've been looking up some algorithms that determine if numbers are prime or not, and I've found some that are really interesting.

Please read the first two parts (Primes and GCD) of this article: [link](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/mathematics-for-topcoders/)

I won't go into the algorithms since I think the article does a very good job of that. So here's the problem for this week: [link](https://codeforces.com/contest/1041/problem/B)

Also, my solution for last week's problem: [link](https://github.com/calgagi/problems/blob/master/leetcode/0052/answer.cpp)
